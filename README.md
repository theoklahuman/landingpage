# landingpage

This is a simple project to test my knowledge css and flexbox basics. the objective is to build a webpage from scratch using mostly what was learned in the "Intro to CSS" and "Flexbox" courses on the odin project. 

I got the all the pictures I used from pexels.com

The design image (what the finished product should look like) is stored in the "objective" folder in "images".

Assignment instructions:

Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Donâ€™t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. :D
